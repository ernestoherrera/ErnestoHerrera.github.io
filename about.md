## Hi, I am Ernesto Herrera

 a computer engineer who has worked for over two decades in software development. I am interested in all software developement facets involved in taking software to production. One part of that is making tools that accelerate and aid in the development process. 
 In writing software, 

 - I like it to be as minimal as possible --less code less bugs.
 - Consiced, precised and fast.
 - Rely on the system to describe itself.

 That's enough for technical talk. I am a husband, father, brother, son. I like to spend time with my family. One of the pass times that we enjoy as a family is watching the Voice tv show. Practically everyone in my family can sing and do it well. On the other hand, my singing notes would burst someone's ears. I can't carry a tune for the life of me.

Other things that I like to do:

 - Take vacations with family.
 - Triathlons
 - Forged in Fire TV series. I'd like to learn to be a blacksmith.
 - AGT, The Voice, Alone, and Suits TV series.
